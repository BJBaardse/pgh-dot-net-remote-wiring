# Pittsburgh .NET User Group - Remote Wiring, Arduinos and More
Learn how to connect to and control your Arduino using Microsoft's Remote Wiring API. We will connect a Universal Windows Application (UWP) 
to a microcontroller (Arduino UNO) to react to tapping some wired-up hardware buttons. After, we'll continue the journey by sending these button
presses up as telemtry events to an Azure IoT hub ... and then back again as a Microsoft Band WebTile

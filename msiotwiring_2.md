### Serial Wiring

The Serial-Wiring framework provides an Arduino compatible stream layer over USB, Bluetooth and Network connected Arduinos.
This provides the foundation for implementing serial-based protocols (you know, like Firmata) when communicating with your
microcontroller.  If you have your own custom serial protocol, this layer is where you will start as well.
